# cs210project
In this project, I delved into my personal Spotify 'Liked Songs' playlist to uncover insights about my music preferences. My analysis spanned exploring the top genres, identifying my favorite artists, and discerning the emotional soundtracks that resonated with me during different months, as well as observing how my music tastes evolved with the changing seasons.For data cleaning and preprocessing, I utilized the pandas library to manipulate the data, which involved handling missing values, parsing timestamps into a datetime format for time-based analysis, converting data types to the appropriate formats for analysis, and removing any duplicate song entries along with Selenium and Beautiful Soup for web scraping.The exploratory data analysis (EDA) incorporated the use of pandas for data handling, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization. Additional notes in my analysis include the potential for sentiment analysis of song lyrics to further understand the emotional undertones of my music preferences and the use of Spotify's audio features like danceability, energy, and valence to comprehend the characteristics of the songs I prefer.
In conclusion, this project has been a comprehensive analysis of my Spotify listening habits, using data science techniques to unravel the patterns and preferences in my musical taste. It's an insightful application of analytics to my personal dataset, demonstrating how data can reflect individual preferences and emotions in music.
